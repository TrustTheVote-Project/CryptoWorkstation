** HOWTO BURN BOOTABLE ISO **
*****************************

Contemporary personal computers (PCs) have two types of bootable external
media devices, CD/DVD and USB.  This document describes how to burn an ISO
file generated by the LiveCD-Creator program (on Fedora 13 Linux) onto such
devices, under Fedora Linux or Windows.

If you have a PC with Fedora 12/13 Linux installed, the process of burning
ISOs to either CD/DVD or USB is almost trivial.  For CD/DVD, insert a blank
one, right-click on the ISO file, select "Write to Disk..."  and then hit
[Burn].  For USB, install the Fedora Live USB Creator (from the command line
type: sudo yum install liveusb-creator), then use it to burn the ISO onto a
USB drive.

If you have a PC running Windows XP or Vista, download CDBurnerXP from
http://www.cdburnerxp.se/, install it and follow its instructions to burn ISOs
to CD/DVD.  For USB, the Fedora Live USB Creator is also available for
Windows, download it from https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/, install
it, and follow the instructions to burn the ISO onto a USB drive.
